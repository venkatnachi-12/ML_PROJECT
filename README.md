# ML_PROJECT
We have trained various types of ML models to predict the cost required to transport medical equipment to different hospitals based on the dataset given to us. The dataset has many numerical and categorical features which we used to predict the transport cost. Target variable was transport cost for this problem. We used linear regression, lasso and ridge regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Principal component analysis with ridge regression, Adaboost Regressor, XGBoost, Gradient boost regressor and finally Elastic Nets. Out of these 10 models PCA with ridge regression gave the best result which is lowest root mean squared error(RMSE) in our case. For navigating through the files just go to ML Models directory and from there go to subdirectories which were created for each model. For each model you can access the notebook codes and submission csv files by just by visiting those subdirectories. Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis done on PCA with ridge regression has been put separately inside the ML Models directory.
